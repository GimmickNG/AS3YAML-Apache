# AS3YAML-Apache
A fork of the AS3YAML library using the new AS3Commons Collections library (licensed under Apache 2)
Imported from the [as3yaml Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/as3yaml/), but with the collections library used changed to the new [AS3Commons Collections framework](https://github.com/AS3Commons/as3commons-collections) in order to comply with the Apache 2.0 license instead of the MPL 1.1 license.

Note: As it stands, the AS3YAML library is licensed under the MIT license. However, since the underlying AS3Commons Collections library it uses is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, this fork is also licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
